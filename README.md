## Keep in Mind

1. historical boundaries are even more disputed than contemporary ones, that
2. the actual concept of territory and national boundary becomes meaningful, in Europe, only since the [Peace of Westphalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia) (1648), that
3. areas of civilizations actually overlap, especially in ancient history, and that
4. overlaying these ancient vector maps on contemporary physical maps can be misleading; rivers, lakes, shorelines _do_ change very much over millenia; think for instance about the evolution of the [Aral sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aral_Sea) since the 1980s.

Finally, note that overlapping areas are useally dealt with as topological errors in traditional GIS. Fuzzy borders are difficult to handle. Certainly a field to investigate...
